        <h2>Arakta</h2>
        <img src="images/Arakta.png" alt="Arakta pomegranate">
        <p>The ‘Arakta’ variety of pomegranate is presently under commercial cultivation in various regions of Maharashtra. Pre-released in the year 1989, it has now been released as ‘Phule Arakta’ for its cultivation by the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri. The ‘Phule Arakta’ variety of pomegranate is a heavy yielder and possesses desirable fruit characters. The fruits are bigger in size, sweet with soft seeds, and have bold red arils. It also possesses glossy, attractive, dark red skin. It is less susceptible to fruit spots and thrips. These little red devils are not only perfect from the outside, but upon consumption, they will make your insides perfect. Here are some flabbergasting facts about the Arakta variety of pomegranate:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto;">
            <li><strong>Lowers Blood Pressure:</strong> High blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the leading drivers of heart attacks and strokes. In one study, people with hypertension had a significant reduction in blood pressure after consuming 5 ounces (150 ml) of pomegranate juice daily for two weeks. Other studies have found similar effects, especially for systolic blood pressure, which is the higher number in a blood pressure reading. Moreover, regular intake of pomegranate juice has been shown to lower blood pressure levels in as little as two weeks.</li>
            <li><strong>The Power of Punicalagin:</strong> Punicalagins are extremely potent antioxidants found in pomegranate juice and peel. They’re so powerful that pomegranate juice has been found to have three times the antioxidant activity of red wine and green tea. Pomegranate extract and powder are typically made from the peel, due to its high antioxidant and punicalagin content.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-inflammatory Properties:</strong> Chronic inflammation is one of the leading drivers of many serious diseases. This includes heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and even obesity. Pomegranates have potent anti-inflammatory properties, which are largely mediated by the antioxidant properties of the punicalagins. Test-tube studies have shown that they can reduce inflammatory activity in the digestive tract, as well as in breast cancer and colon cancer cells. One 12-week study in people with diabetes found that 1.1 cups (250 ml) of pomegranate juice per day lowered the inflammatory markers CRP and interleukin-6 by 32% and 30%, respectively. If you are interested in reducing inflammation in your body, pomegranate is an excellent addition to your diet.</li>
            <li><strong>Red Grenade Against Arthritis:</strong> Arthritis is a common problem everywhere. There are many different types, but most involve some form of inflammation in the joints. Given that the plant compounds in pomegranate have anti-inflammatory effects, it makes sense that they could help treat arthritis. Interestingly, laboratory studies suggest that pomegranate extract can block enzymes that are known to damage joints in people with osteoarthritis. This extract has also been shown to relieve arthritis in mice, but evidence from human-based research is very limited so far.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves Memory:</strong> There is some evidence that pomegranate can improve memory. One study in surgical patients found that 2 grams of pomegranate extract prevented deficits in memory after surgery. Another study in 28 older adults with memory complaints found that 8 ounces (237 ml) of pomegranate juice per day significantly improved markers of verbal and visual memory. Studies in mice also suggest that pomegranate may help fight Alzheimer’s disease. Some evidence shows that pomegranate may improve memory in older adults and post-surgery. In addition, studies in mice suggest that it may protect against Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
            <li><strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> These pomegranates are one of the healthiest foods on the planet, packed with nutrients and powerful plant compounds. They have wide-ranging benefits and may help reduce your risk of various serious illnesses, including heart disease, arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions. What’s more, they may boost your memory. Say goodbye to those 5 almonds a day! If you want to reap the many health benefits pomegranates have to offer, either eat the arils directly or drink pomegranate juice.</li>

        <h2>Mridula</h2>
        <img src="images/Mridula.png" alt="Mridula pomegranate">
        <p>This variety has all the characters of the Ganesh variety except the arils are dark red in colour. The colour of the arils in 'Ambe' bahar and 'Mrig' bahar is dark red in colour while it is pink during the 'Hasta' bahar. 
            The average fruit weight is 250-300 grams.Pomegranate has impressive Anti-Inflammatory properties. Two compounds in pomegranates – punicalagins and punicic acid – are responsible for most of the health benefits of pomegranate. 
            Pomegranates also have antioxidant activity three times higher than that of red wine and green tea.</p>

        <h2>Ganesh</h2>
        <img src="images/Ganesh.png" alt="Ganesh pomegranate">
        <p>This variety is developed by selection method (selection from Alandi). It is a prolific bearer, fruit are medium-sized with yellow, smooth, and red tinge. Seeds are soft with pinkish aril. Juice tastes sweet. It is the commercial cultivar of Maharashtra. The average yield ranges from 8-10 kg per tree.</p>
    
        <h3>Benefits of Health</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto;">
            <li><strong>Antioxidants:</strong> Pomegranate seeds get their vibrant red hue from polyphenols. These chemicals are powerful antioxidants. Pomegranate juice contains higher levels of antioxidants than most other fruit juices. It also has three times more antioxidants than red and green tea. The antioxidants in pomegranate juice can help remove free radicals, protect cells from damage, and reduce inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> The juice of a single pomegranate has more than 40 percent of your daily requirement of vitamin C. Vitamin C can be broken down when pasteurized, so opt for homemade or fresh pomegranate juice to get the most of the nutrient.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancer Prevention:</strong> Pomegranate juice may help stop the growth of prostate cancer cells. Although results are still preliminary, there have been encouraging findings in studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Alzheimer's Disease Protection:</strong> The antioxidants in pomegranate juice are believed to stall the progress of Alzheimer's disease and protect memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Digestion:</strong> Pomegranate juice can reduce inflammation in the gut and improve digestion, benefiting people with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory bowel diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-Inflammatory:</strong> Pomegranate juice's high concentration of antioxidants makes it a powerful anti-inflammatory agent, reducing inflammation throughout the body and preventing oxidative stress and damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Arthritis:</strong> Flavonols in pomegranate juice may help block inflammation that contributes to osteoarthritis and cartilage damage. Studies are ongoing for its effects on other types of arthritis and joint inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>Heart Disease:</strong> Pomegranate juice appears to protect the heart and arteries, improving blood flow and preventing arterial stiffness and plaque buildup.</li>
            <li><strong>Blood Pressure:</strong> Drinking pomegranate juice daily may help lower systolic blood pressure, beneficial for heart health.</li>
            <li><strong>Antiviral:</strong> Pomegranate juice, rich in vitamin C and other immune-boosting nutrients, can prevent illness and fight infections. It has shown antibacterial and antiviral properties in lab tests.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitamin-Rich:</strong> Besides vitamin C and vitamin E, pomegranate juice is a good source of folate, potassium, and vitamin K.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Drinking 8 ounces of pomegranate juice daily may improve learning and memory, according to recent studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Sexual Performance and Fertility:</strong> Pomegranate juice's antioxidants and impact on oxidative stress suggest it may aid fertility and increase testosterone levels in both men and women.</li>
            <li><strong>Endurance and Sports Performance:</strong> Pomegranate juice may reduce soreness, improve strength recovery, and decrease oxidative damage caused by exercise.</li>
            <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> While more research is needed, pomegranate may help decrease insulin resistance and lower blood sugar levels.</li>

        <h2>Ruby</h2>
        <img src="images/Ruby.png" alt="Ruby pomegranate">
        <p>This variety is developed at IIHR, Bangalore. The mature fruits resemble cultivar 'Ganesh' with respect to shape and size. However, the rind of this variety is reddish brown with green streaks containing red bold arils. The fruit weighs 270 g with an average yield of 16-18 tonnes/ha.</p>
        <p>I am talking about the pomegranate, thought to have originated in Persia and the Sub-Himalayan foothills of Northern India. It is now produced at a commercial scale in the Mediterranean regions.</p>
        <p>This fruit is unique in that instead of eating the bitter, spongy, white membrane inside the pomegranate, it is the tiny seeds – called arils – inside which are eaten. Each aril is a delicious sac of juice that surrounds an edible seed, ranging in colors from pink to dark red.</p>
        <p>Pomegranates are not only delicious and beautiful but also nutritious. They are high in vitamin C and potassium, a good source of dietary fiber which aids in smooth digestion and bowel movements, and low in calories. One half cup of arils is about 80 calories but contains 5 grams of fiber. The fruit is also a good source of vitamin C, which helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents by boosting immunity. Researchers have found regular consumption of pomegranate to be effective against prostate cancer, diabetes, and lymphoma.</p>
        <p>To choose ripe pomegranates, look for well-developed, firm, bright crimson red fruit that feels heavy for its size. The heavier it feels, the juicier it will be. Avoid spotted, over-mature fruits as they can be bitter and inedible. Also, avoid those with surface cracks, mold, and bruised or shriveled fruit as they are inferior in flavor. Once home, store them in a cool, dark place at room temperature for 5-8 days or more. Pomegranates generally possess a long shelf life and can also be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>Follow the three-step method to retrieve the arils: First, cut off the “crown,” then score the outer layer of the skin into sections. Second, place the pomegranate in a large bowl of water and break apart the sections along the score lines. Roll out the arils with your fingers; the arils will sink to the bottom while the white membrane floats to the top. Third, strain out the water, and the arils are ready to eat and enjoy. You can purchase the arils without the shell, but they can be pricey.</p>
        <p>Fresh arils placed in an airtight container will keep for a few days in the refrigerator. If you choose to freeze them, freeze in single layers on trays, then package in an airtight container for up to 6 months. Remove only the arils that you plan to use at the time.</p>
        <p>There are many uses for pomegranate arils. They make an attractive garnish on salads and dishes, can be made into juice for drinking or later use in preparing soups, jellies, sorbets, sauces, and to flavor cakes, baked apples, and other desserts. Pomegranate concentrate is a popular ingredient used in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean recipes.</p>
    </section>

    <p>These are just a few examples of the many pomegranate varieties available. Each variety has its own unique characteristics and uses, so it's worth trying out a few to see which one you like best!</p>
